async function handleWaitlistSignup(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const email = event.target.querySelector('input[type="email"]').value;
    
    try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/waitlist', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify({ email })
        });
        
        if (response.ok) {
            // Show success message
        } else {
            // Handle error
        }
